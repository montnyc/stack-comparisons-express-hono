# Stack Performance Comparison: Legacy vs Modern Node.js

This repository contains two identical API applications implemented with different technology stacks to compare their performance characteristics.

## Project Structure

- `/legacy` - Traditional Express.js Stack

  - TypeScript
  - Express.js
  - npm
  - ESLint + Prettier
  - Jest

- `/modern` - Modern Hono Stack
  - Hono
  - pnpm
  - Biome
  - SWC
  - tsx
  - Vitest

## Purpose

This project aims to demonstrate the performance differences between a traditional Node.js setup and a modern, optimized stack. Both implementations provide identical functionality, allowing for direct comparisons in:

- Build times
- Runtime performance
- Bundle sizes
- Developer experience
- Memory usage
- Request handling capacity

## Getting Started

### Legacy Stack

```bash
cd legacy
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Modern Stack

```bash
cd modern
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

## Performance Comparison

(Results will be added after implementation)
